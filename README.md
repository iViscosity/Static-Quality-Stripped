# Static-Quality-Stripped
A stripped down version of ZLJ's Static Quality Plus. Contains only the Static Quality part, and made Harmony-compatible.

Borrows most of the code from the [original mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=737358776), but edited to be Harmony-compatible and remove the unrelated features (plant resting period, skill degredation, etc). This makes the addon smaller, cleaner, and now compatible with [Mad Skills](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=731111514).

## Disclaimer
The main functionality of this code does not belong to me, and I will remove it if the original owner sees fit.
